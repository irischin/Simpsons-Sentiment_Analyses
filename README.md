Sentiment Analyses of the Simpsons
----------------------------------

This directory contains the code for the sentiment analyses I performed on the Simpsons corpus (details on how the corpus itself was collected is in the `Simpsons-Flanderization` directory). There were two analyses in particular that I performed: (1) calculating the general positive/negative sentiment of the Simpsons corpus and (2) calculating the "anger" and "joy" sentiments of Homer (in comparison to the other family members) across the seasons.

In this directory you will find:
